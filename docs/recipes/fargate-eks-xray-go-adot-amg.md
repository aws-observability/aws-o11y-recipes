# Using AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in EKS on Fargate with AWS X-Ray

!!! warning
    This site is being merged into the broader [Observability Best Practices](https://aws-observability.github.io/observability-best-practices/recipes/) content. Please head over there for the latest updates, plus prescriptive guidance on the use of AWS observability tools.

!!! warning
    This site will be kept as-is until January 2023, when it will be decommissioned.

***

In this recipe we show you how to instrument a sample Go application
and use [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws.amazon.com/otel) to 
ingest traces into [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) and visualize
the traces in [Amazon Managed Grafana](https://aws.amazon.com/grafana/).

We will be setting up an [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) cluster and use an
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) repository
to demonstrate a complete scenario.

!!! note
    This guide will take approximately 1 hour to complete.

## Infrastructure
In the following section we will be setting up the infrastructure for this recipe. 

### Architecture

The ADOT pipeline enables us to use the 
[ADOT Collector](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-otel-collector) to 
collect traces from an instrumented app and ingest them into X-Ray:

### Prerequisites

* The AWS CLI is [installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) in your environment.
* You need to install the [eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html) command in your environment.
* You need to install [kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html) in your environment. 
* You have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed into your environment.
* You have the [aws-observability/aws-o11y-recipes](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-o11y-recipes/)
  repo cloned into your local environment.

### Create EKS on Fargate cluster

Our demo application is a Kubernetes app that we will run in an EKS on Fargate
cluster. So, first create an EKS cluster using the
provided [cluster_config.yaml](./fargate-eks-xray-go-adot-amg/cluster-config.yaml).

Create your cluster using the following command:

```
eksctl create cluster -f cluster-config.yaml
```

### Create ECR repository

In order to deploy our application to EKS we need a container repository. We
will use the private ECR registry, but you can also use ECR Public, if you
want to share the container image.

First, set the environment variables, such as shown here (substitute for your
region):

```
export REGION="eu-west-1"
export ACCOUNTID=`aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text`
```

You can use the following command to create a new ECR repository in your account: 

```
aws ecr create-repository \
    --repository-name ho11y \
    --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true \
    --region $REGION
```

### Set up ADOT Collector

Download [adot-collector-fargate.yaml](./fargate-eks-xray-go-adot-amg/adot-collector-fargate.yaml) 
and edit this YAML doc with the parameters described in the next steps.


```
kubectl apply -f adot-collector-fargate.yaml
```

### Set up Managed Grafana

Set up a new workspace using the 
[Amazon Managed Grafana â€“ Getting Started](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/amazon-managed-grafana-getting-started/) guide
and add [X-Ray as a data source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/x-ray-data-source.html).

## Signal generator

We will be using `ho11y`, a synthetic signal generator available
via the [sandbox](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-o11y-recipes/tree/main/sandbox/ho11y)
of the recipes repository. So, if you haven't cloned the repo into your local
environment, do now:

```
git clone https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-o11y-recipes.git
```

### Build container image
Make sure that your `ACCOUNTID` and `REGION` environment variables are set, 
for example:

```
export REGION="eu-west-1"
export ACCOUNTID=`aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text`
```
To build the `ho11y` container image, first change into the `./sandbox/ho11y/`
directory and build the container image :

!!! note
    The following build step assumes that the Docker daemon or an equivalent OCI image 
    build tool is running.

```
docker build . -t "$ACCOUNTID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/ho11y:latest"
```

### Push container image
Next, you can push the container image to the ECR repo you created earlier on.
For that, first log in to the default ECR registry:

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region $REGION | \
    docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
    "$ACCOUNTID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com"
```

And finally, push the container image to the ECR repository you created, above:

```
docker push "$ACCOUNTID.dkr.ecr.$REGION.amazonaws.com/ho11y:latest"
```

### Deploy signal generator

Edit [x-ray-sample-app.yaml](./fargate-eks-xray-go-adot-amg/x-ray-sample-app.yaml)
to contain your ECR image path. That is, replace `ACCOUNTID` and `REGION` in the
file with your own values (overall, in three locations):

``` 
    # change the following to your container image:
    image: "ACCOUNTID.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/ho11y:latest"
```

Now you can deploy the sample app to your cluster using:

```
kubectl -n example-app apply -f x-ray-sample-app.yaml
```

## End-to-end

Now that you have the infrastructure and the application in place, we will
test out the setup, sending traces from `ho11y` running in EKS to X-Ray and
visualize it in AMG.

### Verify pipeline

To verify if the ADOT collector is ingesting traces from `ho11y`, we make
one of the services available locally and invoke it.

First, let's forward traffic as so:

```
kubectl -n example-app port-forward svc/frontend 8765:80
```

With above command, the `frontend` microservice (a `ho11y` instance configured
to talk to two other `ho11y` instances) is available in your local environment
and you can invoke it as follows (triggering the creation of traces):

```
$ curl localhost:8765/
{"traceId":"1-6193a9be-53693f29a0119ee4d661ba0d"}
```

!!! tip
    If you want to automate the invocation, you can wrap the `curl` call into
    a `while true` loop.

To verify our setup, visit the [X-Ray view in CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#xray:service-map/)
where you should see something like shown below:

![Screen shot of the X-Ray console in CW](../images/x-ray-cw-ho11y.png)

Now that we have the signal generator set up and active and the OpenTelemetry
pipeline set up, let's see how to consume the traces in Grafana.

### Grafana dashboard

You can import an example dashboard, available via
[x-ray-sample-dashboard.json](./fargate-eks-xray-go-adot-amg/x-ray-sample-dashboard.json)
that looks as follows:

![Screen shot of the X-Ray dashboard in AMG](../images/x-ray-amg-ho11y-dashboard.png)

Further, when you click on any of the traces in the lower `downstreams` panel,
you can dive into it and view it in the "Explore" tab like so:

![Screen shot of the X-Ray dashboard in AMG](../images/x-ray-amg-ho11y-explore.png)

From here, you can use the following guides to create your own dashboard in
Amazon Managed Grafana:

* [User Guide: Dashboards](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/dashboard-overview.html)
* [Best practices for creating dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/best-practices/best-practices-for-creating-dashboards/)

That's it, congratulations you've learned how to use ADOT in EKS on Fargate to 
ingest traces.

## Cleanup

First remove the Kubernetes resources and destroy the EKS cluster:

```
kubectl delete all --all && \
eksctl delete cluster --name xray-eks-fargate
```
Finally, remove the Amazon Managed Grafana workspace by removing it via the AWS console.
