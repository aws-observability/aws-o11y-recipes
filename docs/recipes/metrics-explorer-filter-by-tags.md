In this recipe we show you how to use Metrics explorer to filter, aggregate, and visualize metrics by resource tags and resource properties - [Use metrics explorer to monitor resources by their tags and properties][metrics-explorer].

There are number of ways to create visualizations with Metrics explorer; in this walkthrough we simply leverage the AWS Console.

!!! note
    This guide will take approximately 5 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

* Access to AWS account
* Access to Amazon CloudWatch Metrics explorer via AWS Console
* Resource tags set for the relevant resources 


## Metrics Explorer tag based queries and visualizations

*  Open the CloudWatch console 

*  Under <b>Metrics</b>, click on the <b>Explorer</b> menu

*  You can either choose from one of the <b>Generic templates</b> or a <b>Service based templates</b> list; in this example we use the <b>EC2 Instances by type</b> template

*  Choose metrics you would like to explore; remove obsolete once, and add other metrics you would like to see

*  Under <b>From</b>, choose a resource tag or a resource property you are looking for; in the below example we show number of CPU and Network related metrics for different EC2 instances with <b>Name: TeamX</b> Tag

// width="386" height="176" -->

*  Please note, you can combine time series using an aggregation function under <b>Aggregated by</b>; in the below example <b>TeamX</b> metrics are aggregated by <b>Availability Zone</b>

Alternatively, you could aggregate <b>TeamX</b> and <b>TeamY</b> by the <b>Team</b> Tag, or choose any other configuration that suits your needs

## Dynamic visualizations
You can easily customize resulting visualizations by using <b>From</b>, <b>Aggregated by</b> and <b>Split by</b> options. Metrics explorer visualizations are dynamic, so any new tagged resource automatically appears in the explorer widget.
