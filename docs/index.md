# Welcome!

We are covering recipes for observability (o11y) solutions at AWS on this site.
This includes managed services such as [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus][amp]
and [Amazon Managed Grafana][amg] as well as agents, for example [OpenTelemetry][otel]
and [Fluent Bit][fluentbit]. We want to address the needs of both developers and
infrastructure folks.

The way we think about the o11y space is as follows: we decompose it into
[six dimensions][dimensions] you can then combine to arrive at a specific solution:

| dimension | examples |
|---------------|--------------|
| destinations  | [Prometheus][amp] &middot; [Grafana][amg] &middot; [OpenSearch][aes] &middot; [CloudWatch][cw] &middot; [Jaeger][jaeger] |
| agents        | [ADOT][adot] &middot; [Fluent Bit][fluentbit] &middot; CW agent &middot; X-Ray agent |
| languages     | [Java][java] &middot; Python &middot; .NET &middot; [JavaScript][nodejs] &middot; Go &middot; Rust |
| infra & databases  |  [RDS][rds] &middot; [DynamoDB][dynamodb] &middot; [MSK][msk] |
| compute unit | [Batch][batch] &middot; [ECS][ecs] &middot; [EKS][eks] &middot; [AEB][beans] &middot; [Lambda][lambda] &middot; [AppRunner][apprunner] |
| compute engine | [Fargate][fargate] &middot; [EC2][ec2] &middot; [Lightsail][lightsail] |

For example, you might be looking for a solution to:

!!! question "Exemplary solution specification"
    I need a logging solution for a Python app I'm running on EKS on Fargate
    with the goal to store the logs in an S3 bucket for further consumption

1. *Destination*: S3 bucket for further consumption
1. *Agent*: FluentBit
1. *Language*: Python
1. *Infra & DB*: N/A
1. *Compute unit*: Kubernetes (EKS)
1. *Compute engine*: EC2

Not every dimension needs to be specified and sometimes it's hard to decide where
to start. Try different paths and compare the pros and cons of certain recipes.

To simplify navigation, we're grouping the six dimension into the following
categories:

- **By Compute**: covering compute engines and units
- **By Infra & Data**: covering infrastructure and databases
- **By Language**: covering languages
- **By Destination**: covering telemetry and analytics
- **Tasks**: covering anomaly detection, alerting, troubleshooting, and more

## How to use

You can either use the top navigation menu to browse to a specific index page,
starting with a rough selection. For example, `By Compute` -> `EKS` ->
`Fargate` -> `Logs`.

Alternatively, you can search the site pressing `/` or the `s` key:

The recipes on this site are a good practices collection. In addition, there 
are a number of places where you can learn more about the status of open source
projects we use as well as about the managed services from the recipes, so 
check out:

- [observability @ aws][o11yataws], a playlist of AWS folks talking about 
  their projects and services.
- [AWS observability workshops](workshops/), to try out the offerings in a
  structured manner.

  to case studies and partners.
