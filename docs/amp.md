# Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus

[Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus][amp-main] (AMP) is a Prometheus-compatible
monitoring service that makes it easy to monitor containerized applications at scale. 
With AMP, you can use the Prometheus query language (PromQL) to monitor the
performance of containerized workloads without having to manage the underlying 
infrastructure required to manage the ingestion, storage, and querying of operational
metrics.
