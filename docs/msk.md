[Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka][msk-main] (MSK) is a fully managed service that makes it 
easy for you to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process 
streaming data. Amazon MSK continuously monitors cluster health and automatically
replaces unhealthy nodes with no downtime to your application. In addition, 
Amazon MSK secures your Apache Kafka cluster by encrypting data at rest.
