# Amazon CloudWatch

[Amazon CloudWatch][cw-main] (CW) is a monitoring and observability service built 
for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers.
CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, 
and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications, 
and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers.
