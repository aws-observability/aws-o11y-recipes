[Amazon Relational Database Service][rds-main] (RDS) makes it easy to set up, 
operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient 
and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such 
as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups.
